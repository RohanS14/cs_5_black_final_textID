So far, our text ID project has gone smoothly. We have completed the functions required for the milestone using Live Share on VS Code, which has allowed us to seamlessly collaborate on our code as we debug side-by-side. Throughout this process, we have learned about some new libraries and syntax, such as string.punctuation, defaultdict, and the porter algorithm. Next, we will continue to write and test our functions on sample txt files.
