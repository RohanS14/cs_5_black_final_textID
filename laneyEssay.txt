Muddy Glove
        In the poem, “Yellow Glove,” Naomi Shihab Nye recounts a story of how she lost a precious yellow glove as a child. Nye received the yellow gloves as a Christmas gift, and despite feeling an immense pressure to never lose them, she accidentally drops one of them into a stream that leads to a storm drain. Worried about how her mom will react, Nye keeps one hand in her pocket and wears one glove on the other for months, never telling her mom that she lost the glove. Then, one day the glove mysteriously appears; as Nye puts it, it was a miracle on Harvey Street (20)[a]. Throughout the poem, it is apparent that Nye’s work is littered with surprising word choices and metaphors. Curiously enough, Nye opens the poem with, “What can a yellow glove mean in a world of motorcars and governments?” (1). Nye places the whole poem in the context of items that seemingly have little to do with losing a glove. However, upon closer inspection of the role of the gloves, the mother, and the stream, “Yellow Glove” can actually be interpreted to be a critique on the idea that talent and hard work lead to success within capitalism[b] -- the idea that that capitalism is a meritocracy.[c][d]
        The gloves themselves represent the hope of class mobility within capitalism because of their ties to wealth and status. [e]Right after Nye describes losing the glove, she says, “Gloves cost money. We didn’t have much” (8). Already, it is apparent that these gloves are a symbol of wealth because they cost so much. In high society, gloves signify the wealth and high social status of the wearer. Royalty have worn them throughout history, and they often show up in media portrayals of socialites like that of Holly Golightly in the movie “Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” Those of the working class would also wear gloves to conceal their hands that had been hardened and tanned from manual labor as a way to present themselves as being wealthier. For those of lower class, gloves don’t signify wealth itself, but the desire to attain wealth (or at least the desire to not be of the working class). In the context that Nye “didn’t have much”, it is reasonable to conclude that[f] the yellow gloves encapsulate the prospect of class mobility. [g]
        The mother represents the harmful implicit pressures that the government and the rest of society places on the lower class. Before Nye even introduces the gloves, she prefaces with the idea that[h] “Life was a string of precautions,” citing the rules, “Don’t kiss the squirrel before you bury him, don’t suck candy, pop balloons, drop watermelons, watch TV” (1-2). One can infer that Nye is referring to rules set by her mother. Later in the poem, Nye continues to list rules, saying, “Don’t scream, don’t lie, don’t cheat, don’t fight—you could hear it anywhere” (13-14). However, the idea that Nye “could hear it anywhere” implies that the rules that come from her mom are more intrinsic to life itself. This hints that the mom represents something greater than just herself.[i] Embodying the source of all rules and norms, the mother represents societal expectations. We can see this when Nye says “I would wear the yellow glove that was left and keep the other hand in a pocket. I knew my mother’s eyes had tears, they had not cried yet, I didn’t want to be the one to make them flow” (8-10)[j]. She would rather not show her hands to her mom at all than just pretend she doesn’t[k] feel like wearing gloves. This attempt to make her mother happy by hiding her hands mimics how the working class hid their hands to conform with societal expectations[l][m]. Despite wanting to make her mother happy, the mother is placing a large burden on Nye to always hide one of her hands, revealing that the pressure one feels to succeed within society is actually more inhibiting than encouraging. Additionally, Nye feels as though asking her mother for another glove is completely off limits, as the possibility of this is never even discussed. [n]This is representative of how a capitalist society offers little support to those who are struggling, and the resulting expectation of those with less to be self-reliant rather than seek help and resources. 
The power of the stream in the poem reveals that one[o] has little control over their position in society, implying that working class jobs are not opportunities to climb up in society but instead are exploitative. When Nye describes how she lost her glove, she says, “One day, waving at a stream—the ice had cracked, winter chipping down, soon we would sail boats and roll into ditches—I let a glove go. Into the stream, sucked under the street. Since when did streets have mouths?” (5-7)[p]. Instead of simply saying the glove fell into the storm drain, she says it was actively sucked under the street. This wording makes it seem as if [q]she had very little control over the situation. If the glove does represent a hope of class mobility, then the stream represents the antithesis,[r] the idea that class mobility is unlikely. Since the stream sweeps her glove away, Nye is implying that one actually has little control over changing their position within society. At any moment an opportunity could be “sucked” away from those who are less fortunate -- it has nothing to do with one’s merit. After Nye loses the glove (or her hope of class mobility), she says, “I sang and drew and fattened the cat” (13). A “fat cat” is a phrase used to describe a capitalist that gets rich off of the exploitation of others. Thus, when Nye says she was fattening the cat, she may actually be saying she was helping the rich get richer.[s] As she goes about her daily life without this hope that she could work her way up in society, she feels exploited by the economic system.[t]
Even though Nye still tries to move up within society, she now understands that the idea is impractical, as it has more to do with luck than skill. When Nye mentions the stream again, she says, “A stream could remember how to drift and change—next June I was stirring the stream like a soup, telling my brother dinner would be ready if he’d only hurry up with the bread” (15-17)[u]. This time, Nye is stirring the stream[v]. The act of stirring the stream shows that Nye is attempting to gain control over her position in society, as she is trying to determine[w] how the stream flows. Interestingly, as soon as Nye starts “stirring the stream,” the yellow glove appears (18). This means that as Nye attempts to gain control over her position in society, the prospect of class mobility presents itself. What’s more, the glove has appeared almost magically[x]; she never actively searched for it. This highlights that the main factor influencing class mobility is actually chance rather than merit. The glove is also “a muddy survivor” when it finally returns to Nye, which provides a stark contrast to the original yellow color of the gloves (18). This[y] mirrors how the hope of wealth is no longer bright and optimistic to Nye like it once was, but instead dull and unpromising. She says, “I could wash it, fold it in my winter drawer with its sister, no one in that world would ever know” (19-20). She says she could take the glove back, but she never says if she actually does. She is indecisive. This is because after her experience losing the glove the first time, she is weary of this prospect, now seeing the hope of attaining wealth as unlikely and impractical.[z] She understands that a stream could sweep the glove away again at any moment, or that capitalism is rarely a form of meritocracy. 
        By reading into the social connotations of gloves, the role of the mother, and the wording around the stream, “Yellow Glove” can be interpreted to be commentary on meritocratic capitalism. Nye may be arguing that capitalism is not actually a meritocracy, while also illuminating the damaging expectations and pressures that society places on the lower class.[aa]

[a]rlly good background on what story is about
[b]if your looking to cut your thesis a bit you could easily take this part out and use it in your "restatement" of your thesis in your conclusion - you could just say the idea that capitalism is a meritocracy in this thesis in your intro and then instead of using that same wording in you thesis in your conclusion you could use the "talent and hard work lead to success" in your conclusion
[c]get help with wording
[d]maybe: we are able to recognize that "Yellow Glove" is a critique on the idea that capitalism is a meritocracy
[e]I would maybe at a bit more context before the quote to create stronger evidence sandwich - a sentence or two more of background information
[f]Is this needed?
[g]elaborate a bit more on class mobility - i 100% see what you are saying but all the sentences prior to this talk about how gloves represent wealth and then you only mention class mobility in this sentence which is the last sentence so i would maybe expand a bit more on this before you end the paragraph especially because it's in your topic sentence
[h]if appropriate maybe a bit more background context to this quote as well
[i]greater authority
[j]shorten this
[k]NO CONTRACTIONS.
[l]What are these expectations for the working class? Norms is a good word use. Who sets in norms in society? Not the working class.
[m]Presentable vs. "scruffy", quiet, obedient, subservient
[n]Better transition. Is Nye afraid to ask for support or is the mother unavailable?
[o]Do not overuse one.
[p]Split this int smaller blocks of quote+analysis.
[q]Concise - e.g. This diction suggests that
[r]not sure comma is right here. dash?
[s]i think a little more analysis here might be beneficial - what exactly does nye do to contribute to fattening the cat
[t]Maybe reverse the progression of ideas in these two sentences. Also, you are rushing at the ends of the paragraphs. Don't neglect the progression of ideas.
[u]Shorten a bit.
[v]Why is she stirring the stream? Wokring hard or hardly workingHAHAHAHAH
[w]Not the right word. Control, direct the flow...
[x]Unpack her choice of the word "miracle". Implies magical connotation or by chance, hidden mechanism
[y]Use some other sentence starters for variety.
[z]Hope is reclaimed but dulled, replaced with apprehension.
[aa]what you have for the conclusion is really good but I would suggest maybe adding an extra sentence of just a higher insight thought or some other out of the box idea to expand on what you have - something thought provoking for the reader to end your essay
[ab]Add more about what this commentary is. Connect to hope.
